  "description": "Depending on the variety, shape and naturalness of rock crystal, it has significantly different healing effects. In general, the larger the stone, the more powerful its effect. In addition: raw stones possess rather Yang energy, tumbled / cut stones rather Yin energy. Rock crystals should be placed directly on the corresponding body parts, a possible tip on it directed, or as rock crystal water to be taken. If the rock crystal is worn as a pendant or amulet on the skin, then it exerts its powers directly on its wearer. If it is worn over clothing, it exerts the best effect as a protective stone, but only if it is worn at the level of the solar plexus. It is recommended to always use a rock crystal for the same purpose, if possible, because it stores information structures over time and dissolves them only slowly. If the stone has a tip, then it should be worn downwards. Thus it provides for gue grounding. With the tip up, the stone can concentrate energies in the upper chakras in an uncomfortable way. Also, the other end of the healing stone should be as free as possible, i.e. not have a closed silver or gold cap or setting at this point. Stones with two pointed ends are less powerful than those with only one point. Rock crystal intensifies the effect of all other stones and moderates too intense stones. It is thus both an intensifier and one of the great balancing stones. From a size of about two-fist-size rock crystals are called generators. They are then particularly suitable for the protection and clarification of rooms.",
