    More than 60 raw gemstones, presented on posts, can be marveled at and touched. Small explanatory panels provide the necessary background knowledge, which also does not omit the healing effects of certain stones or small anecdotes. At the heart of the complex are 12 precious stones, which according to biblical tradition (Revelation, chapter 21) form the foundation of the New Jerusalem.

The garden is open all year round.
